# Webpack Template

A barebones setup that includes:
* babel for es2015/jsx compiling
* hot component reloading
* eslint (AirBnB styleguide)

`npm start` will start a dev server at `localhost:8080`. Use `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/bundle` for a visible status bar.

`npm build` will uglify the bundle in production mode (this will trigger the production mode of React).
